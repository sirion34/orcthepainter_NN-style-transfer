## General information

This bot can transfer style from one picture to another. I used pre-trained VGG19, and slow algorithm with Gram matrix. After all, you'll got original image with the style of second image. Also you can turn on calculations on GPUs. *NN.py* is the neural network and *main.py* is the bot itself.
